## Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Fixed |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Critical | 0 | N/A |
| High | 3 | 3 |
| Medium | 5 | 5 |
| Low | 4 | 4 |
| Informational | 3 | N/A |

## Critical Issues (None Found)

The codebase has no critical security vulnerabilities. Key security measures in place:
- Proper authentication via Supabase Auth
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- CSRF protection via origin validation
- SSRF protection in image proxy
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM

---

## High Severity Issues

### H1: Missing `default_source` in GET /api/users/me select (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/app/api/users/me/route.ts` lines 98-104  
**Issue**: The `default_source` field was added to schema but not included in the select clause for GET requests.  
**Impact**: Users cannot retrieve their default source preference setting.  
**Fix**: Added `default_source: true` to select clause.

### H2: Server Action Missing Input Validation (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/lib/actions/library.ts`  
**Issue**: Server actions lack proper input validation for seriesId, entryId, chapter, and status parameters.  
**Impact**: Potential for malformed data to reach database, causing errors or inconsistent state.  
**Fix**: Added Zod validation schemas and validation checks.

### H3: Race Condition in Username Uniqueness Check (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/app/api/users/me/route.ts` lines 284-300  
**Issue**: Time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition between checking username uniqueness and updating.  
**Impact**: Two users could potentially claim the same username.  
**Fix**: Use database unique constraint as primary enforcement, catch P2002 error as backup.

---

## Medium Severity Issues

### M1: Notification markAsRead Lacks Ownership Check (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/lib/social-utils.ts` line 76-81  
**Issue**: The `markNotificationsAsRead` function didn't verify the notification belongs to the user when marking single notification.  
**Impact**: User could potentially mark another user's notification as read.  
**Fix**: Added `user_id: userId` to where clause.

### M2: Library Entry Delete Missing Cascade Cleanup (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/app/api/library/[id]/route.ts`  
**Issue**: When deleting library entry, associated UserChapterRead records should be cleaned up.  
**Impact**: Orphaned read progress data remains in database.  
**Fix**: Added cascade cleanup of UserChapterReadV2 records.

### M3: Missing Content-Security-Policy Headers (FIXED)

**Location**: `next.config.ts`  
**Issue**: No CSP headers configured for the application.  
**Impact**: Potential XSS attacks not mitigated at header level.  
**Fix**: Added security headers in next.config.ts.

### M4: Follow Self Prevention Missing in UI (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/lib/social-utils.ts` line 237  
**Issue**: Self-follow prevention exists in backend but error message is generic.  
**Impact**: Poor user experience when attempting to follow self.  
**Fix**: Return specific error message for self-follow attempts.

### M5: Image Proxy Missing DNS Rebinding Protection (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/lib/constants/image-whitelist.ts`  
**Issue**: DNS rebinding attacks could bypass IP checks if DNS TTL is exploited.  
**Impact**: Potential SSRF via DNS rebinding.  
**Fix**: Added additional hostname validation and documented limitation.

---

## Low Severity Issues

### L1: Inconsistent Error Response Format (FIXED)

**Location**: Various API routes  
**Issue**: Some endpoints return `{ error: string }` while others return `{ error: string, code: string }`.  
**Impact**: Frontend must handle multiple error formats.  
**Fix**: Standardized error responses via handleApiError.

### L2: Missing Pagination Limit on Activity Feed (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/lib/social-utils.ts` line 333  
**Issue**: Activity feed accepts limit parameter but doesn't enforce maximum.  
**Impact**: Large limit values could cause performance issues.  
**Fix**: Added Math.min(limit, 100) enforcement.

### L3: Streak Calculation Edge Case (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/lib/gamification/streaks.ts`  
**Issue**: Streak calculation doesn't handle timezone differences properly.  
**Impact**: Users in different timezones might have streak reset unexpectedly.  
**Fix**: Added UTC-based day comparison.

### L4: Chapter Progress Not Idempotent (FIXED)

**Location**: `src/app/api/library/[id]/progress/route.ts`  
**Issue**: Marking same chapter as read multiple times could award XP multiple times in edge cases.  
**Impact**: XP farming potential via race conditions.  
**Fix**: Added `isNewChapter` check is already present, added UserChapterReadV2 deduplication.

---

## Informational Findings

### I1: Rate Limit Store Uses In-Memory Storage

**Location**: `src/lib/api-utils.ts`  
**Note**: Rate limiting uses in-memory Map which resets on server restart and doesn't work across multiple instances.  
**Recommendation**: Consider Redis-based rate limiting for production at scale.

### I2: No Request Logging/Audit Trail

**Note**: No centralized logging of API requests for security auditing.  
**Recommendation**: Implement structured logging with request IDs for production debugging.

### I3: Password Hash Field Exists But OAuth-Only

**Location**: `prisma/schema.prisma` line 15  
**Note**: `password_hash` field exists but application uses Supabase Auth (OAuth).  
**Recommendation**: Consider removing unused field or document its purpose.

- [x] sanitizeInput removes HTML tags
- [x] SVG blocked in image proxy
- [x] Content-Type validation on proxied images

### CSRF Protection
- [x] validateOrigin on mutation endpoints
- [x] SameSite cookie attributes via Supabase

### SSRF Protection
- [x] Image proxy whitelist domains
- [x] isInternalIP blocks private ranges
- [x] IPv6 mapped addresses blocked
- [x] Cloud metadata IPs blocked

## Test Coverage Recommendations

1. Add integration tests for authentication flows
2. Add security regression tests for each fixed issue
3. Add performance tests for database queries
4. Add end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
